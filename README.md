T.O.M. Tool (Total overhaul maintenance tool)

Simple to use recovery for the campzone 2020 badge. Use this when your badge won't boot anymore due to filesystem errors.

!! Before you can run this tool, you will need to update the STM32 chip on your badge here: https://webupdate.hackz.one.

This tool flashes the latest firmware and the stock fs on the badge with a single press on your enter key.  
Note that this tool in current form is very experimental and should only be used as last resort.
